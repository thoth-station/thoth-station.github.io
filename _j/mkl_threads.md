title: Consider adjusting OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable for containerized deployments
---

Consider adjusting ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` environment variable for containerized
deployments, one or more libraries use Intel's MKL that does not detect
correctly resource allocation in the cluster.

## Issue description

OpenMKL detects number of CPUs present on a machine where the application runs.
This generally does not need to correspond to number of CPUs allocated for
containerized applications. Refer to [Kubernetes documentation][4] to get more
information about assigning CPU requests to a pod.

Consider also adjusting additional environment variables such as (see
[tensorflow/tensorflow#23238](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/23238#issuecomment-737618693)):

```console
export TF_ENABLE_MKL_NATIVE_FORMAT=1  
export TF_NUM_INTEROP_THREADS=1
export TF_NUM_INTRAOP_THREADS=4
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
export KMP_BLOCKTIME=1
export KMP_AFFINITY=granularity=fine,compact,1,0
```

## Affected packages:

 * ``intel-tensorflow``
 * ``pytorch``

## Severity

 * WARNING

## Issue fix

Make sure the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` environment variable is set and corresponds
to number of CPUs allocated for the container.

## Pipeline units

 * [MKLThreadsWrap](https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/adviser/thoth.adviser.wraps.html#module-thoth.adviser.wraps.mkl_threads)

## Recommendation types

 * latest
 * performance
 * secure
 * stable
 * testing

See [this document that describes recommendation types
listed](http://thoth-station.ninja/recommendation-types).
 
## Advised manifest changes

Patch manifest for the deployed component (e.g. ``Job``, ``Deployment``,
``DeploymentConfig`` or any other) so that ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` is set to number
of CPUs requested for the container run.
