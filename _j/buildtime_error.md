title: Removing a package due to build time error in the software environment
---

The given package was removed from the resolution process as it produces errors
during installation in the given environment.

## Issue description

Thoth runs background analyses that make sure recommended packages have high
quality. One of such analyzers is [thoth-solver][2] that besides resolving
dependencies also captures information if the given package is installable into
the environment used.

The fact a package is not installable into the given environment can be caused
by multiple issues. Besides Python 2 and Python 3 incompatibilities in
``setup.py``, issues like missing native dependencies in the environment (e.g.
C toolchain to build native extensions) are also applicable.

## Affected packages:

This warning is not tight to any specific package.

## Severity

 * WARNING

## Issue fix

Resolver will try to find another valid resolution path without the given
package.
