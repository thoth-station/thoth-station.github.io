title: TensorFlow in version <=1.14 used overpinned gast package, using gast in version <=0.2.2
---

TensorFlow<=1.14 works with gast<=0.2.2.

## Issue description

If using TensorFlow<=1.14 with a newer release of gast than 0.2.2, the
application can crash with the following error:

```console
AttributeError: module 'gast' has no attribute 'Num'
```

The issue is in update in gast package to 0.3.0 where ``Num`` constant was
removed. See [the corresponding commit][1].

## Affected packages:

 * ``tensorflow<=1.14``
 * ``tensorflow-cpu<=1.14``
 * ``tensorflow-gpu<=1.14``
 * ``intel-tensorflow<=1.14``
 * ``gast``

## Severity

 * WARNING

## Issue fix

Resolver will try to come up with a different resolution path so that
TensorFlow<=1.14 will use gast in version <=0.2.2 without the issue described.

## Pipeline units

 * [TensorFlow114GastStep](https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/adviser/thoth.adviser.steps.html#thoth.adviser.steps.TensorFlow114GastStep)
